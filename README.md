# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* **Callback Functions** - Callback functions are functions, that are passed into another function as an argument. With our blender function example in mind what if we had a kitchen function that takes in the blender function, but first cooks something in the microwave then 'uses' or 'calls back' to our blender function once that is done.
	* **Closure** - A closure is a function that is inside another function. Think of the inner function as the child to outer function or parent function it's inside of. If there are variables inside of the parent function, the child function can use those variables.
	* **`arguments`** - The arguments object holds each argument or input that is passed into a function. If you are not sure how many arguments have been passed into a function, you can look at the arguments object.
	* **Recursion** - Recursion is used to solve a problem that can solved by doing a single task over and over again until the problem is solved. You will know when to stop when you don't need to do the task anymore. For example if you're walking up some steps you know you need to repeatedly lift each foot to a certain height to clear each step. Once there are no more steps though, you don't need to lift your foot to that height anymore because there are no more steps.
	* **`prototype`** - A prototype is something that all objects have. It's like a recipe for how to create the object. Like a recipe prototypes can save us time because they tell us exactly what we need to do to make what we want.
	* **Constructors** - Constructors are functions used to make object prototypes. Inside the constructors we write our recipe which then can be used each time we want to make a new object. Now we don't have to remember how to make the object each time we want to make a new one because we have a prototype thanks to the constructor.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
